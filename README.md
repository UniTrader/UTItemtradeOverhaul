# UTItemtradeOverhaul

Usage:
Just do your Itemtrade as Usual and notice that the Stocks and Prices now follow a System instead of being completely random.

How it works:
Each Ware gets some Stations in the Universe assigned (currently completely Random, but the Code for adding Criteria for Selection per Ware is already in Place - just need some input what the criteria should be) which are either Source or Sink. The Prices and Stock Levels depend on the Distance from the nearest Source and the Distance to the nearest Sink. Also on the Source and Sink Stations you can find the best offers for the respective Ware.

ToDo:
-> Re-Shuffle Source and Sink Stations regulary (currently its only done once on Installation)
-> Add criteria for the Source and Sink Stations so they are chosen more logically (depending on Space (Sector/Zone/Cluster), Station Macro and/or Station Owner )
-> Add some further Bonusses for Item Trading? (like Efficiency Bonus for a Station)
